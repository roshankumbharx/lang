INTRODUCTION \\nProposed an AI -based mock interview behavioral recognition system that simulates real -time interview scenarios using a virtual \\nrecruiter. The system captures and analyzes multimodal inputs such as facial expressions, speech patterns, and emotional  responses \\nto assess a candidate’s performance. It integrates machine learning models for emotion detection, pe rsonality recognition, an d \\nsentiment analysis, providing users with detailed feedback and progress tracking across sessions. Their work highlights the potential \\nof AI in improving interview preparedness by offering objective, data -driven insights into behavioral traits. This research lays the \\ngroundwork for implementing intelligent virtual coaching systems in career readiness tools.  [1]. Prepmania advances this further \\nthrough the integration of computer vision and speech processing algorithms to evaluate user perform ance accurately. Other \\nresearch has examined the effectiveness of dynamic, chatbot -driven mock interviews that adapt depending on the user\\'s response \\nand track their performance over time — a function that informed Prepmania\\'s personalized question generation and real -time \\nperformance-monitoring functionality [2]. The platform leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning \\nalgorithms to analyze both verbal and non -verbal responses in real time. Key features include context -specific question generation, \\nspeech recognition, sentiment analysis, and performance scoring. The system provides immediate feedback on various aspects  such \\nas communication skills, confidence, body language, and technical knowledge. By offering personalize d and scalable support, t his \\nAI-powered solution serves as an innovative tool in career development and recruitment preparation. [3]. \\nInterview preparation is an essential part of job acquisition, especially in today\\'s competitive job  market. Traditional prep aration \\ntechniques, such as mock interviews wit h peers or mentors, are subjective in feedback, intermittent, and not comprehensive in \\nassessment. These practices are most likely to yield little behavioral information, and it is diffic ult for candidates to tra ck their real \\nprogress. \\nTo address these sho rtcomings, we present Prepmania — a computer -based mock interview platform, built using Next.js and a \\nmodern web stack. The platform delivers role -specific, user-profile-based interview questions and evaluates verbal and non -verbal \\ncues through multimodal an alysis, including body language, tone, and speech intelligibility. These behavioral signals help del iver \\nobjective, real-time feedback to candidates, enabling them to identify improvement areas and enhance their interview readiness. \\nPrepmania does this by using a very detailed feedback dashboard that compares user responses with the best responses generated by \\nAI and displays progress in graphs and reports. This paper captures the system design, development p rocess, and initial user \\nresponse for Prepmania. The findings set the potential of AI and web technologies to transform the interview preparation pro cess to \\nmake it more streamlined, personalized, and evidence-based.'),\n",

RELATED WORK \\nPrevious studies in the area of intelligent hiring technologies have shown promising outcomes in the  use of video and behavio ral \\nanalytics to extend the assessment of candidates.  \\nContemporary software like HireVue and MyInterview employs AI -driven video t ests to examine the facial expressions, tone of \\nvoice, and speech of candidates. Such systems, however, are mainly developed for assessment from the  recruiter\\'s perspective and \\ndo not focus much on learning and monitoring development of candidates. \\nConversely, Prepmania is user -oriented as it aims to improve interview preparation by means of an interactive online experience. \\nThrough our site, we incorporate body posture analysis, voice measurement, and computer -mediated response analysis for the \\npurposes of mimicking actual interview settings and providing constructive criticism to the user in real time. \\nThe research \"Efficacy and Benefits of Virtual Mock Interviews: Analyzing Student Perceptions of Dig ital Employment \\nPreparations\" by Indiana University of P ennsylvania\\'s LeAnn Wilkie and Joseph Rosendale  [19] identifies the requirement of \\nreplicating real interview procedures while providing complete, personalized critiques on nonverbal communication, response \\ntiming, and content value. This outlook is consistent with Prepmania\\'s aim to exactly replicate real interview situations and provide \\nconstructive feedback. \\nSimilarly, the research paper \"AI -Based Mock-Interview Behavioral Recognition Analyst\" by Kolpe, Patil, Deshmukh, Jeughale, \\nand Misal emphasizes the  need for artificial intelligence systems that can accurately decipher nonverbal behavior, support va ried \\ninterview styles, and offer end -to-end performance analysis [1]. Prepmania follows these recommendations by using AI models to \\nexamine physical behavior and communication effectiveness in real time. \\nThe paper titled \"Conversate: Supporting Reflective Learning in Interview Practice Through Interacti ve Simulation and Dialogi c \\nFeedback\" by Taufiq Daryanto et al. (2024)  [18] presents a next-generation AI-driven interview simulation tool aimed at fostering \\nreflective learning among users preparing for job interviews. Conversate utilizes state -of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs ) \\nsuch as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to not only simulate realistic interview conversations but also support learners in reviewing, analyzing, \\nand improving their answers iteratively. \\nThis research by P. K. Mishra, A. K. Arulappan, I. -H. Ra, T. M. L, G. R. G and Y. -S. Lee, \"AI-Driven Virtual Mock Interview \\nDevelopment,\" 2024 Joint 13th Inter national Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems and 25th International \\nSymposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems (SCIS&ISIS), Himeji, Japan, 2024, pp. 1-4, doi:  \\n10.1109/SCISISIS61014.2024.10760210 [16] contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of AI in creating adaptive \\nlearning environments, particularly in the context of professional skill development. The virtual mo ck interview system serves as a \\ntool for users to engage in self -paced, reflective practice, ultimate ly aiming to boost confidence and competence in real -world \\ninterview settings. \\nShi, W., Wang, D. Empirical research on the application of AI mock interviews in enhancing graduate perceived employability: a \\ncase study in Hangzhou, China.  Educ Inf Technol  (2025) [17]. This study investigates the effectiveness of AI -powered mock \\ninterviews in enhancing the perceived employability of university graduates in Hangzhou, China. Amid st a competitive job market \\nand increasing graduate numbers, the research aims to de termine whether AI -driven interview simulations can bolster graduates\\' \\nconfidence and readiness for employment. Participants reported a significant increase in their self -assessed employability after \\nundergoing AI mock interviews. The AI simulations contri buted to better performance in actual interview scenarios, suggesting \\npractical benefits beyond self-perception. \\nAlso, sites like Interviewsby.ai show the growing demand for artificial intelligence -based mock interviewing sessions. The site \\nprovides topic -specific questions and provides user performance feedback based on AI. Efficient as they may be, mos t such \\ncomparable sites are proprietary or do not support full multimodal testing. Prepmania addresses this requirement by combining real-\\ntime question gene ration, body language monitoring, vocal analysis, and answer comparison in an open, web -based environment \\nexclusively for students and job seekers. \\nTogether, these studies identify the increasing ability of artificial intelligence to enhance interv iew read iness and provide key \\nlessons on which Prepmania is founded.'),\n",

CONCLUSION \\nThe article covered Prepmania, a web -based mock interview platform developed with Next.js in conjunction with a contemporary \\nfrontend/backend tech stack. The platform combines functionalities such as question creation, multim odal analysis, visualization of \\nperformance, and timed evaluations to provide immersive and educational interview practice. Prospect ive future enhancements \\ncould involve a boost in real-time processing, broader API coverage, and support for adaptive difficulty in questions. \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] S. Kolpe, S.
